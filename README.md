# Car Rental App With C#

In this project, I aimed to create a car rental application. To explain briefly: On the homepage, you can see registered cars, registered customers, and rented cars. Through the menu bar, you can access pages for car editing and renting, customer editing and debt viewing, as well as invoice viewing.

When the application is launched, it provides warnings if the maintenance or insurance dates of the vehicles are approaching. If a vehicle is under maintenance, you can select the "Under Maintenance" option through the car editing section. If a vehicle is available, it is marked as "Available," and if rented, it is marked as "Rented."

For every vehicle whose rental period is completed, an invoice is generated for the customer who rented it and is marked as "Unpaid." On the Invoices page, you can mark paid invoices as "Paid" simply by double-clicking on them.

On the Customer Debts page, only the unpaid debts of the selected customer are displayed.

I hope you like the project, and please donâ€™t hesitate to share any areas you find lacking. ðŸ™Œ
